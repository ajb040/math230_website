<h1 class="title toc-ignore">üéì More Than Just Studying: The Complex
Puzzle of Student Success</h1>

</div>


<p>We often hear that students who study more get better grades ‚Äî and
that‚Äôs largely true. But performance isn‚Äôt only about study time. This
data story explores how <strong>other factors</strong>, like
<strong>sleep habits</strong>, <strong>social media use</strong>, and
<strong>physical exercise</strong>, play subtle but meaningful roles in
shaping student outcomes.</p>
<hr />
<div id="section-1-study-hours-the-strongest-predictor"
class="section level2">
<h2>üìç Section 1: Study Hours ‚Äì The Strongest Predictor</h2>
<p><img src="Test_files/figure-html/hist-exam-score-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The distribution shows a typical bell shape, with most students
scoring between 70 and 90. But what separates the top performers?</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="Test_files/figure-html/study-vs-score-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As expected, there‚Äôs a clear upward trend: students who spend more
time studying tend to score higher. However, not all students who
studied more performed best ‚Äî suggesting other influences at play.</p>

<h2>üò¥ Section 2: Sleep ‚Äì A Support System</h2>

<p>Sleep appears to have a positive but moderate effect on
performance.</p>

<p>This interactive chart shows the balance between sleep and study.
High scores cluster in areas where both sleep and study hours are
moderate to high, supporting the idea that sleep doesn‚Äôt detract from
success ‚Äî it supports it.</p>

<h2>üì± Section 3: Social Media ‚Äì A Subtle Distraction</h2>
<p><img src="Test_files/figure-html/social-vs-score-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Time spent on social media shows a negative correlation with exam
scores. The more time students spend scrolling, the lower their
performance tends to be.</p>
<p><img src="Test_files/figure-html/social-vs-study-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Based on the previous graph, I would naturally assume that Social
Media Hours would be taking away valuable study hours from students, but
according to this graph it has little to no change. This might show that
Social Media causes the study hours to be less effective by serving as a
distraction for students.</p>

<h2>üèÉ Section 4: Exercise ‚Äì A Positive Influence</h2>
<p><img src="Test_files/figure-html/exam-vs-exercise-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Regular exercise shows a small but encouraging positive trend in exam
scores. Students who exercised 3‚Äì5 times per week tended to outperform
peers who exercised less.</p>

<h2>üé≠ Section 5: Extracurricular Participation ‚Äì A Balancing Act</h2>
<p><img src="Test_files/figure-html/extracurricular-vs-score-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, students who participate in extracurriculars have
slightly higher median scores. This suggests that involvement outside of
academics doesn‚Äôt hurt ‚Äî and may even help by promoting time management
or relieving stress.</p>

<p>The correlation matrix ties everything together. Study time shows the
strongest positive correlation with exam scores, followed by sleep and
exercise. Social media has a negative relationship ‚Äî reinforcing the
patterns we saw in the individual graphs.</p>

</div>
<div id="final-thoughts" class="section level2">
<h2>üèÅ Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This data story reveals that <strong>study hours</strong> are the
strongest predictor of success ‚Äî but not the only one. Students who also
sleep well, exercise regularly, and minimize social media distractions
tend to do better. Academic performance is a
<strong>multi-dimensional</strong> outcome, shaped by how students
manage their time, habits, and well-being.</p>
