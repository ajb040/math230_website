## 👋 Welcome

My name is Andrew Bond and welcome to my virtual data visualization exhibit for *MATH 230: Data Visualization & Computing*. This site showcases my work throughout the semester, culminating in a personal data story about how lifestyle habits influence student exam performance.

## 🖼️ What You'll Find Here

### 🎓 **Data Story: More Than Just Studying**

In this project, I explore the idea that **study hours are only part of the equation** when it comes to academic performance. Using data on sleep, social media, exercise, and extracurricular involvement, I dive into the *complex puzzle* of student success.

### 🎨 **Past Visual Work**

Throughout the semester, I've created a variety of visualizations exploring different datasets, techniques, and design principles — from generative art to dashboards and statistical graphics.

## 🎯 Purpose

This site is both a **portfolio** and a **storytelling exhibit**. It reflects what I've learned about programming in R, visual design, and data interpretation. Whether you're here as a peer, professor, or curious reader, I hope you leave with a clearer picture of how **data shapes our understanding** of the world — and how design shapes our understanding of data.

Thanks for stopping by!
