## üéì More Than Just Studying: The Complex Puzzle of Student Success

We often hear that students who study more get better grades ‚Äî and that‚Äôs largely true. But performance isn‚Äôt only about study time. This data story explores how **other factors**, like **sleep habits**, **social media use**, and **physical exercise**, play subtle but meaningful roles in shaping student outcomes.

```

```{r correlation-matrix}
ggcorr(data %>% select(study_hours_per_day, sleep_hours, social_media_hours, exercise_frequency, exam_score), label = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Correlation Between Variables")
```

## üèÅ Final Thoughts

This data story reveals that **study hours** are the strongest predictor of success ‚Äî but not the only one. Students who also sleep well, exercise regularly, participate in extracurriculars, and minimize social media distractions tend to do better. Academic performance is a **multi-dimensional** outcome, shaped by how students manage their time, habits, and well-being.
